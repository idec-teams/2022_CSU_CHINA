Based on bacterial conjugation: a new idea of multifactor screening





**Abstract**

Bacterial conjugation is a process in which bacteria recombinate gene through temporary communication of cells and transfer of genetic material. Modern research shows that it can promote gene exchange of bacteria to promote population evolution. For example, it can usually lead to the spread of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, making treatment more difficult.Through in-depth understanding of bacterial conjugation, we propose a multi factor screening idea based on it, which provides a new idea for directed evolutionary screening.

In order to test the feasibility of the theory, we chose a multi factor model to explore the effects of various factors ­——the bipeptide bacteriocin PLNC8 secreted from Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ316 on the inhibition of Helicobacter pylori growth. Through the separate evolution and random combination of the two peptide chains, to explore the structural mechanism of their bacteriostatic effect，or try to evolve bacteriocin with better bactericidal effect.
